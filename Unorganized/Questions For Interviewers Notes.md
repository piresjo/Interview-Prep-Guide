# Questions For The Interviewer

## Intro

Usually, at the end of an interview, the interviewer(s) will give you five or ten minutes to ask questions about the company or role. While this isn't a critical part of the interview process, asking the right questions can help push the needle a bit when it comes to getting that offer.

Specificity is key to asking questions. You want to ask questions that are as specific to the company and role as much as possible. This will give the interviewer the sense that:

- You have some knowledge about the company and the role.
- You have clear interest in the company and/or role.

## Questions Tailored To The Company

The questions should be custom to the company. If you ask a question that could easily apply to any other company, then that’s generally a bad question.

Here's an example of a bad question to ask:

> Can you tell me what the culture is like at Facebook?

This is a bad question because it is simply too broad. It can be applied to any company. Furthermore, the interviewer might consider a question like that a tell that the applicant did not do as much research as they should have when it comes to working at the company.

Below is a slightly better question to ask:

> Given Facebook has grown to be a large scale thus far with 50k+ employees, how do you still maintain the pace of velocity?

This is a better question because it's less broad (the applicable companies are similar large companies). However, it's still quite broad.

Here's an even better question to ask:

> What has been the strategy for incorporating the Metaverse into Facebook’s existing Family of Apps like Instagram, News Feed, WhatsApp and Messenger given those apps follows a feed experience, while the Metaverse follows a 3-D immersive experience?

There's only one company that this question can be ask for. Furthermore, the references to various parts of Meta's product selection indicates that the applicant knows at least some things about the company.

## Questions Tailored To The Role

The questions should be custom to the role. Even if your question is company-specific, it should ideally be targeted to the role you’re interviewing for.

> How much latitude do engineers have when it comes to defining what is on their roadmap at Facebook?

This is a bad question to ask, because it can apply to any engineering role at Facebook. Even worse: this can be minimally modified to be used for any company. Once again, it seems like the applicant did not do as much research as they should have when it comes to working at the company.

> Since I’m interviewing for an ML Platform role, I’d love to know how much I can use my personal experience using PyTorch to help prioritize what we work on?

This is a better question as this narrows the scope of the question to a few teams at Meta. 

> I follow the PyTorch subReddit and they’ve mentioned a lot of open source community requests aren’t prioritized as much as Facebook internal feature needs. If i were to join the PyTorch Infra team, can I put together user feedback panels from some of the community’s power users for the team?

This is an even better question to ask, since not only does it apply to a few specific teams, but it also make detailed reference to what the teams are doing. This shows a lot of interest and knowledge of the role and the appropriate engineering teams.

## Questions Tailored To The Interviewer

The recruiters should have give you a heads up around who will be on your interview panel, and you should think about how you can make your question custom for that specific interviewer. This will allow you to get more specific about the role and company.

Imagine you’re interviewing for Instagram Ads Platform team, and one of the interviewers on your panel is a manager for the overall Facebook Ads Platform team of which your team is a customer.

> How does collaboration generally work between a customer and platform team at Facebook? Do I inform your roadmap?

Based off the interviewers, this question doesn't leverage the specific roles of the interviewers.

> What’s are your team’s top priorities when it comes building a robust ads platform?

This question is somewhat better, but it still can apply to other ads-related roles that you’re interview for, it’s not the most ideal.

> I read that Facebook has an auction system where you predict the clickthrough probability of an ad and combine that with a bid value to rank ads. Does Instagram’s ad system extend that auction system, or did Instagram build its own? Since Instagram has a larger proportion of brand advertising, and less action/click-based did they build their own infra?

This is a much better question, as it makes it clear you know what you’re talking about, and it’s a question that is custom to the given interviewer. It’s a question likely that interviewer would be able to answer (and nobody else).
