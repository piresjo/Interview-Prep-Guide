    General idea: An easy way to do this is through heapsort.
    In other words, feed all the contents of the lists into a heap
    (python defaults to a minheap with heapq).

    When you create the new list to return, it's easier to create a dummy head,
    and make the real head the next node after that. With that, keep popping values
    from the minheap and create a new node based off that, adding that to the
    list.
