    General idea: we need to use DFS to get the leaves in proper order
    (BFS will also take what layer the leaf is into account, which
    would screw up the order). Then you can just compare the lists.
    For ease, we're passing the sequences into the aux method so they 
    get modified, since passing in a list is passing in by reference.
