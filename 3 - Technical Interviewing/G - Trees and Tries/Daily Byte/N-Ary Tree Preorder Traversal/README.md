Given an N-ary tree, return a list containing the preorder traversal of its elements.
Note: You may assume that each node in the tree has a children attribute to access all of its N child nodes.

Ex: Given the following N-ary tree…

```
       1
     / | \
    2  3  4, return [1, 2, 3, 4].
```
Ex: Given the following N-ary tree…

```
       1
     /   \
    2     3 
        / | \
       4  7  9, return [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9].
```
