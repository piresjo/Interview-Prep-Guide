# Here's How to Prepare for Tech Interviews (Notes)

Setting expectations: If this is your first time looking for a job, or you haven't had to interview in a number of years, expect to invest some effort in preparing for the interview. It's usually the industry professionals that completely ignore this step, but some college students do as well. You're essentially studying for a test, don't slack off - it's going to be work.

## Data Structures

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack/Queue
- Trees (Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc. Learn as many as you can)
- Heap
- Hash Table (this is really important - understand all of the different collision mitigation mechanisms, understand what amortized constant-time means)
- Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs
- Trie (pronounced "tree")
- Linked Hash Map (this is very specific, but comes up a LOT in interviews)

You should know the Big-O for insert, delete, lookup, etc. for each of these. Know how the mechanics work.

If you don't remember how they work, go through some pages (Geeks4Geeks, WikiPedia, etc.) and research the data structures. It would also be helpful

## Algorithms

Again, you want to code these out yourself and look up its Big O space and time properties.

Some big ones to look into:

- Sorting algorithms (both comparison sorting and non-comparison sorting)
- Tree traversals (just memorize all of these inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)
- Traversals - Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS (know the difference between DFS and BFS when would you use one over the other and why - hint, is usually matters when you don't have to search the whole space. Also make sure that you can code recursively and using your own stack/queue)
- All the prefix-tree searches

## Determining Gaps And Fixing Them

Some things to look into:

- Bits and Bytes - Yes, you should understand how all that bitshifting stuff works in whatever language you're going to interview with. You should know what big and little endian are. Do a couple practice questions, even simple one. Try something like..."write a method to determine if the bit-wise representation of an integer is a palindrome."
- How the internet works. This applies more to companies....yeah....it applies to everything these days. You should know how sockets work, you should know what TCP/IP is. You should know what HTTP actually is. Learn your networking layers and what's responsible for what You don't need to know all of the details of the protocols, but you should know some of them and that they exist. This sounds daunting, it should only take a couple of hours.
- Databases. Learn some basic SQL and data modeling if the job you're applying for uses databases.
- Learn a bit about testing. Write some code and test it. What's TDD
- If you've only ever used Windows....consider using linux for a bit.
- Whatever else you can think of. A good mental exercise is to imagine yourself in an interview..."man, I hope they don't ask me about X." Figure out what X is and read about it.

## Behavioral

I suggest coming up with 3 situations where you were working on a tech project and things went well, and 3 stories for when things didn't go well. Then practice telling the stories, make sure to include some setup information, what was the setting, what was the project, who was working with you, what was your role...then tell the story....then for the positive stories talk about the impact of your work, did you win, save the company money, what? For the negative stories, finish up by talking about what you learned and how you'd approach the problem differently in the future.
