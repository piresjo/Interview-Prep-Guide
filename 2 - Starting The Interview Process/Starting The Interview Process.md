# General Interview Preparation

## Logistics

Depending on how well you’re prepared, you’ll want to optimize how you plan for and schedule your interviews.

- Day of the Week
  - Pick a day of the week that you tend to do better on interviews.
- Time of the Day
  - Some people are more alert in the morning vs. the afternoon. Select a time of the day that optimizes for your own performance.
- Split across multiple days
  - If you have a full 5+ hours of interviews, I highly recommend that you split them across multiple days, for two reasons:
    - Optimized for your preferred time-of-day. If you’re a morning or afternoon person, you’ll be able to have all your interviews during that time of day.
    - Combat interview fatigue. Interview fatigue is a real problem, especially if you stack 5–6 hours of interviews back-to-back.

### Blocking Time Around Interviews

I recommend that you block off the the 45 minutes right before (for warmup) and 30 minutes after (reflect + over) each of your interviews. This means that you shouldn’t have interviews that go back-to-back.

Ask your recruiting coordinator or scheduler if you can have 30 minutes break in between interviews if possible. This allows you decompress after the prior interview, use the bathroom and take a break, as well as reflect. Some candidates use this time to meditate, especially if the previous interview was not as successful as you would have liked.

### Practising

It’s helpful to warmup for the first 20–30 min. right before your interview. This will help you remove pre-interview jitters and get your in the zone. To do a warmup, do a 1–2 practice questions or “question parts” for the interview by yourself in the same videoconferencing software that you’ll be using for the interview (Zoom, Google Meet, or Cisco Webex) so you can simulate the actual interview.

- If it’s a coding interview, do a quick practice coding problem in the same online IDE (e.g. Coderpad or HackerRank) that your interview will be in.
- If it’s a system design interview, practice talking through the first several minutes of a sample system design problem.
- If it’s a behavioral interview, find 1–2 random interview question and practice physically talking through your answer to those questions.

### Writing Out Questions For The Interviewer

Take the time to write out 3–4 custom questions for the interviewer. The questions should be custom to (1) the company, (2) the role and (3) the interviewer. You have no excuse for not asking an extremely intelligent question of the interview, since this is something you can think about a long time before the interview.

## Starting A Study Routine

### Understanding The Interview

 Ask the recruiter (or any friends you know at the company) what each of the interviews will be like. Often a recruiter will chat with you on the phone about each of the types of interviews and answer any questions you have.

### Prioritizing What To Study

You likely have a really limited amount of time to prepare and study, so don’t try to practice everything. Based on your conversations with the recruiter, focus your preparation on a few key areas.
