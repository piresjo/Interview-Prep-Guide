# Interview-Prep-Guide-V1

## Summary

This is a collection of notes and sample coding challenges I've been using for interviews. This is very much a work in progress, and things are in the beginning stages. Currently, solutions are only in Python. In the future, solutions will be in multiple languages and will include explanations.
