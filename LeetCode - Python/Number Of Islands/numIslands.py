'''
    Solution Summary:
    This is similar to the Leetcode WordSearch problem.
    You have to search through all of the elements in the grid.
    When you find a 1, you can add that to numIslands, but you need
    to process the island (i.e. find a way so that any part of that island isn't double counted).
    That's where we use DFS to process the island.
    Time and Space - O(rows * cols)
