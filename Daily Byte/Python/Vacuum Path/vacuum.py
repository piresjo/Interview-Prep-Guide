''' General Idea:
    If the vacuumer is back in place, it's horizontalDistance and verticalDistance from starting
    point should both be zero. So, set up horizontalDistance and verticalDistance values, have them increase
    when going right/up, and have them decrease when going left/down.

    horizontalDistance = 0
    verticalDistance = 0
    for char in strVal:
        if char == 'L':
            horizontalDistance -= 1
        elif char == 'R':
            horizontalDistance += 1
        elif char == 'U':
            verticalDistance += 1
        else:
            verticalDistance -= 1

    return horizontalDistance == 0 and verticalDistance == 0
