# Intro/Foreword

## What Is This

As per the repository name, this is a guide for software engineering interviews. Ideally, this guide will walk the reader through the process of interviewing, from the beginning stages of preparing for applying to what to do once you get an offer (and, of course, everything in between).

This guide will focus on the technical portion of the interview, followed by the system design portion, followed by the behavioral portion. If this guide is created according to plan, the lionâ€™s share of the guide will focus on the technical portion of the interview process.

Each of those sections are further divided into subsections, going into key concepts. These are followed by sample interview questions related to that topic, complete with answers in multiple languages and explanations as to why the answer is sufficient.

The parts of the interview themselves will not be the only things discussed in this project. I would also like to discuss the preparation that goes into both applying and interviewing, especially since I spend a considerable amount of time preparing before even applying. I would also like to discuss the post-interview process, as that could always provide its own set of curveballs.

## Who Am I

To start off: I am no expert. I am not a recruiter. I do not help with hiring. I do not have decades of experience.

I am just a bog-standard software engineer.

If you are more curious: I am a backend senior software engineer at FanDuel. Before that, I was a backend software engineer at Amazon. Before that, I was a student at the University of Pennsylvania. In terms of experience, I have been working in the software industry since 2017, and I have been programming for almost fifteen years.

In those seven years, I think I have developed a handle on what my strengths are and what my weaknesses are. One of my bigger weaknesses is interviewing. I have always struggled in interviews despite a relatively decent resume. On top of that, my experience as an interviewer is small due to changes in the software industry. Hopefully with this project, I can help rectify that.

## Why Am I Doing This

Frankly, I am mostly doing this for my own sake. I am not the best at interviewing, and my experience with interviewing could use improvement. Ideally, as I go through this project, section by section, I relearn and refine the skills I need to get better at both sides of the interview process. There are three big reasons for me doing this:

- Getting reacquainted with the interview process
  - It has been almost five years since I interviewed for jobs. My memory of that four-month period is a little hazy currently. Hopefully, this guide will help me (and you) get reacquainted with the process.
- Review of key computer science concepts
  - There are plenty of skills that atrophy once you get hired and start working. Unfortunately, most people do not have enough free time to review all those concepts, and many of those fall of the wayside in their brains. This guide should hopefully function as a quick review of core concepts that might not be used much.
- Getting better at answering questions
  - This is the biggest reason. There usually is a world of difference between working as a software engineer and interviewing for a software engineering position. After a while, the skills needed to be good at interviews will degrade. As someone whose skills were not that good to begin with, it is imperative that I improve my skills quickly.

Hopefully, dear reader, you learn something from this as well.

## The Audience

This repository, primarily, is a fancy study guide for me for future endeavors (whether I apply for a new job or, more likely, I start interviewing prospective software engineers again).

That said, this repository is public, and I am assuming that others will be referencing it from time to time. The reader who will get the most out of this guide will be the reader who is most like me:

- Someone who is a US citizen (or, at least, someone who does not need an H1B or H2B visa).
- Someone with a decent amount, but not too much, experience.
- Someone who is backend-oriented.

With all that said, welcome aboard, take this advice at your own risk, and let us begin.
